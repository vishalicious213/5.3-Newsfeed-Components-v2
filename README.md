# Newsfeed-Components

In this project I built a newsfeed reader. It includes a collapsing menu and expandable news articles. Starter HTML and CSS was already provided by the bootcamp I attended. I needed to wire everything up with JavaScript so that the page's functionality worked and implement reusable components to do so.

As a stretch goal, I implemented a "Read more" button in each article that turned into a "Close" button when the article is open.

## Need to know

* CSS (LESS):
  * @import
* JavaScript:
  * Creating DOM components with Javascript Functions
* DOM
  * Element selection
  * Basic DOM manipulation
  * Events and event listeners

## Process & tasks
### Part 1: The Articles Component
* Import `Article.less` from the correct path into index.less (follow the example for `Header.less` if you’re not sure how to write the correct path)
* Follow the instructions found in the Articles.js file to complete the JavaScript functionality and add the components to the DOM.

### Part 2: Add Articles

* Now that we have our components built, add a few articles of your own to the data array. Notice how our JavaScript code automatically creates the new articles and adds the styling and functionality we just built to them. This is the power of components. Write the code once and add as many components as you want all while maintaining the functionality we built!

### Part 3: The Menu

* Import `Menu.less` from the correct path into index.less (follow the example for `Header.less` if you’re not sure how to write the correct path)
* Follow the instructions found in the Menu.js file to complete the JavaScript functionality. 

### Stretch Goals

* Close Button:
  * Add a close (or 'read') button to each Article component. When clicked the article will disappear.
